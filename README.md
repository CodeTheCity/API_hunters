Team API Hunters at CTC15

The goal, we want to download .csv files from (luftdaten.info and madavi.de) using python. At the moment, there is no API to access uploaded data; instead CSVs have to be downloaded from the luftdaten/madavi and then re-amalgamated. The issue, it is too time consuming to individually download the required .csv 
files, by hand.
