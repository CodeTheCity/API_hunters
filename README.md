The goal, we want to download .csv files from (luftdaten.info and madavi.de) using python. At the moment, there is no API to access uploaded data; instead CSVs have to be downloaded from the luftdaten/madavi and then re-amalgamated. The issue, it is too time consuming to individually download the required .csv 
files, by hand. 

Data in the form of tables is also called CSV (comma separated values) - literally 'comma-separated values'. This is a text format intended for the presentation of tabular data. Each line of the file is one line of the table. The values of individual columns are separated by a separator symbol - a comma (,), a semicolon (;) or another symbol. CSV can be easily read and processed by Python.
